# Netflix Data Project

This notebook is all about digging into Netflix's dataset and seeing what kind of content they offer.
I wanted to explore things like how many movies vs. shows are on the platform, which years saw the most content being added, and what genres are the most common.

The dataset includes titles, type (Movie or TV Show), release years, duration, country, and genres, among other things. After loading the data, I spent some time cleaning it — there were a few missing values and duplicate rows, which I handled before jumping into analysis.

Some of the things I looked into:

- How content has grown over the years
- The split between movies and TV shows
- Which countries dominate in content production
- What genres appear the most
- Duration trends (like how long movies or shows usually are)

I used Python for the entire process — mainly pandas for data handling, and matplotlib + seaborn for visualizations. Everything was done in Jupyter Notebook.

The biggest insight for me was how much content Netflix started adding after 2016, and how movies still dominate in number compared to TV shows. Drama and comedy pop up a lot, and the U.S. is by far the biggest contributor of content.

This project helped me improve my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling using real-world data. The full analysis is in the notebook file.

Thanks for checking it out!
